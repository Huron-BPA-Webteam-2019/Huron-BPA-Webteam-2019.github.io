                                                    It tries to focus on the sensory elements of humans, such as visual, auditory, and olfactory senses.<br>
                                                    The design is modified to help mimic natural environments that appeal to these senses. <br>

                                        These Earthship bio homes are able to use less energy and are more cost-friendly, which is very helpful and nice.<br>
                                        They are self sustaining systems, meaning that they can last for a long time; they are durable <br>
                                        They are made from self-recycled or natural material, which is beneficial to the environment<br>
                                        Energy is derived from solar or wind power with small scale windmills and solar panels. <br>

                                                    An example of earthship homes is found in the famous Great Wall of China <br>
                                                    Construction methods similar for earthship homes were applied to the construction of the Great Wall Of China. <br>
                                                    Construction makes it very resistant to weathering. <br>
                                                    Walls range from 19-24 inches which makes it extremely quiet and quickly adapts to changes in noise levels. <br>
