                <h1 align = "center">Challenges With the Logistics of Biohomes</h1>
                <h5>Problems With Energy</h5>
                <p>     While green energy has a high efficiency vs energy input, the energy yield it produces is quite low. <br>
                        The energy sources which are used to power biohomes, such as solar panels, can be quite expensive. <br>
                        Renewable energy sources tend to be vulnerable depending on the location of the energy source, and so a proper, well-maintained place is required for these energy sources.<br>
                        Energy production is slow. This means that the customer has an energy threshold on their consumption monthly.<br>
                </p>
                
                <h5>Problems With Materials</h5>
                <p>
                        As most biohomes have a high demand for solar energy, it raises the need for them to be placed in specific locations that can provide the most sunlight. This moves these biohomes away from regular places to more isolated places.<br>
                        Materials can be hard to find to build the bio homes, especially in most urban areas which are not very bio-friendly areas (Urban areas constitute the majority of the human population)<br>
                        Most biohomes lack an air-cooling system, because they mostly run on heat sources and are not designed for hot areas because they do not have any air ventilation systems<br>
                </p>
                <h5>Problems With Cost</h5>
                        <p>
                        Certain bio homes have materials that are very expensive to use for building<br>
                        It can be difficult to sell your bio homes once you buy them. This is because most realtors and buyers are not aware about green home products and the construction involved. <br>
                        Biohomes can often be hard to maintain for multiple different reasons which include high down-payment costs, bills, etc.<br>
                        </p>

                <h1 align = "center"> Challenges with the EPA </h1>
                <h4>What is the EPA?</h4>
                <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a governmental agency which seeks to protect the health of humans and the environment.<br>
                    It acomplishes its goals by developing and enforcing rules and regulations for companies and states, and other entities.
                </p>
                <h4>What Challenges are there with the EPA? </h4>
                <h5>The Solar Power Purchase Agreement </h5>
                <p> A solar power purchase agreement (SSPA) is an agreement in which a third party operates the system and the customer hosts the system's electric output. <br>
                    Financial benefits are gained by the third party (tax credits and income). <br>
                </p>
                <h5>The Problems With the SSPA Agreement</h5>
                <p>More complex negotiations and potentially higher transaction costs than buying PV system outright. <br>
                        Administrative cost of paying two separate electricity bills if system does not meet 100 percent of the site's electric load.<br>
                        Potential increase in property taxes if property value is reassessed.<br>
                        Site lease may limit ability to make changes to property that would affect PV system performance or access to the system.<br>
                        Understand trade-offs related to REC ownership/sale.<br>
                </p>
