                <h5>Problems With Energy</h5>
                <p>     While green energy has a high efficiency vs energy input, the energy yield it produces is quite low. <br>
                        The energy sources which are used to power biohomes, such as solar panels, can be quite expensive. <br>
                        Renewable energy sources tend to be vulnerable depending on the location of the energy source, and so a proper, well-maintained place is required for these energy sources.<br>
                        Energy production is slow. This means that the customer has an energy threshold on their consumption monthly.<br>
                        Homeowners must take in account the energy yield of their home by assessing the amount of energy their home outputs. Homeowners may not be able to go completely solar if the energy consumption of their home is too inefficient. <br>
                        Energy audits include use tools to analyze the efficiency of energy in homes. <br>

            <h1  class="text-center">Challenges with Cost and Materials</h1>

                <h5>Problems With Cost</h5>
                        <p>
                        Certain bio homes have materials that are very expensive to use for building<br>
                        It can be difficult to sell your bio homes once you buy them. This is because most realtors and buyers are not aware about green home products and the construction involved. <br>
                        Biohomes can often be hard to maintain for multiple different reasons which include high down-payment costs, bills, etc.<br>
                        </p>

                <h5>Problems With Materials</h5>
                        <p>
                                As most biohomes have a high demand for solar energy, it raises the need for them to be placed in specific locations that can provide the most sunlight. This moves these biohomes away from regular places to more isolated places.<br>
                                Materials can be hard to find to build the bio homes, especially in most urban areas which are not very bio-friendly areas (Urban areas constitute the majority of the human population)<br>
                                Most biohomes lack an air-cooling system, because they mostly run on heat sources and are not designed for hot areas because they do not have any air ventilation systems<br>

                <h1 class="center"> Challenges with the EPA </h1>
                
                <h4>What is the EPA?</h4>
                <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a governmental agency which seeks to protect the health of humans and the environment.<br>
                    It acomplishes its goals by developing and enforcing rules and regulations for companies and states, and other entities. 
                    When planning a Bio Home, be sure to follow regulations posted by the EPA. Failing to do so will result in the denial of a request to build a bio home.
                
                </p>
                <h4>What Challenges are there with the EPA? </h4>

                <h5>The Solar Power Purchase Agreement </h5>
                <p> If you are currently interested in buying solar for your current home you might need to look at what a Solar Power Purchase Agreement is. A Solar Power Purchase Agreement (SSPA) is an agreement in which a third party operates the system and the customer hosts the system's electric output. <br>
                    Financial benefits are gained by the third party (tax credits and income). <br>
                </p>
                <h5>The Problems With the SSPA Agreement</h5>
                <p>More complex negotiations and potentially higher transaction costs than buying PV system outright. <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Administrative cost of paying two separate electricity bills if system does not meet 100 percent of the site's electric load.<br>
                        Potential increase in property taxes if property value is reassessed.<br>
                        Site lease may limit ability to make changes to property that would affect PV system performance or access to the system.<br>
                        Understand trade-offs related to REC ownership/sale.<br>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Note that while the EPA regulates environmental issues that are related to houses, installation of renewable energy is mostly a region specific concern. </h4>

            <div class="tab-pane fade show" id="zoning">
                <h1 align = "center">Challenges with Zoning</h1>
                <h4> What are Zoning Laws for? </h4>
                <p>The purpose of zoning laws is to regulate impacts that may not be in the best interests of the people including: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protecting value of properties by separating incompatible land uses.</li>
                        <li>Protecting future developments of the city or town.</li>
                        <li>Regulating public infrastructure.</li>
                      </ul>
                    Zoning laws are often flexible since future plans are not always deterministic.
                </p>
                Zoning laws are region specific. Make sure to research the county's or city's zoning laws to ensure you do not violate any laws. 
                Typically, certain renewable energy types are not specified in a county's or city's zoning laws, but are often still allowed in that county or city. 
                Installation still holds many problems if there are not any specific rules about renewable energy. Neighbors or other residents could

                </p>
<!--                 <p>In mostly urban municipalities, constructing a biohome can often pose a challenge because 
                    of certain regulations/limits like the Police Power Rights. 
                    <br> These regulations prohibit the division of 
                    land for such purposes as building an eco-friendly house in a mostly non eco-friendly area.</p> -->
