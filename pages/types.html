                            Biophilic homes encompass features which are incorporated through color, water,
                            sound, air, plants, and animals.

                                Most biophilic designs include natural patterns and processes which evoke human
                                emotion.
                                Specifically arches, vaults, and domes invoke human emotion.

                                in influencing the way in which we react to them.
                                Most of these designs create a closer connection of humans to the natural world.
                                Biophilic homes aim to reach a design that includes historical, cultural,
                                geographical, spiritual, and/or ecological features in order to strengthen a

                                Prefab houses utilize measurements which are exact to ensure that there is no waste

                                Some prefab homes are constructed with eco-friendly solar panels.

                                    Prefabricated houses can come in various luxury designs.

                                    and can be very cost-effective with a price range of $10,000 to $15,000
                                    They are constructed in a short amount of time compared to traditional homes, since
                                    they are much less labor-intensive. Prefab
                                    homes on average are finished in around 5 months since, with the earliest homes
                                    being constructed in 2
                                    months.

                                    In addition, prefab homes have a lower average permit value. The average permit
                                    value for a
                                    prefab home is $76.80 per square, while a traditional home has an average permit
                                    value of per square foot.

                                These homes are able to use less energy and are more

                                They are self sustaining systems, meaning that they can last for a long time;
                                they are
                                durable.

                                Earthship homes can also be built in convenient locations which can  allow the home owner to grow self-sustainable vegetable gardens allowing them to harvest their food naturally from rain or nearby rivers/streams.

                                    Construction methods similarly used for Earthship homes were applied during the
                                    construction of the Great Wall Of China. This type of construction makes these homes very resistant to weathering. 
                                    In addition, their electrical needs are 25% less than that of a conventional home, and
                                    they also require an entire kilowatt less amount of energy.
                                
                                    The walls of an Earthship home range from 19-24 inches of thickness, making it
                                    extremely quiet and able to quickly
                                    adapt to changes in noise levels. There are little no caveats in regards to compatibility with the home owner in owning an Earthship home besides their cost and mortgages.
