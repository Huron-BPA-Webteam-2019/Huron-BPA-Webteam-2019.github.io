                                    They are constructed in a short amount of time compared to traditional homes, since
                                    they are much less labor-intensive. Prefab
                                    homes on average are finished in around 5 months since, with the earliest homes
                                    being constructed in 2
                                    months.

                                    prefab home is $76.80 per square, while a traditional home has an average permit
                                    value of per square foot.

                                    An example of Earthship homes is found in the famous Great Wall of China.

                                <div>
                                    Construction methods similarly used for Earthship homes were applied during the
                                    construction of the Great Wall Of China.

                                    This type of construction makes these homes very resistant to weathering.

                                <div>
                                    The walls of an Earthship home range from 19-24 inches of thickness, making it
                                    extremely quiet and able to quickly
                                    adapt to changes in noise levels.
