                <p class="info">A bio-home is an <b> environmentally low-impact home</b>
                    designed and built using materials and technology that <b> reduces its carbon footprint and lowers
                        its energy consumption.</b> Bio-homes mitigate the negative impacts that buildings can have
                    on human health and the environment.</p>
                <p>First introduced in the 1960’s - 1970’s during the Green Building Movement. 

                        Eco-friendly houses helped to address the rapidly growing prices of oil during the 1970s. People started looking for more renewable energy sources to maintain the costs of their homes. 
                        The first eco-friendly house was built in Austin Texas in 1992.
                        
                        U.S. Green building foundation was founded in 1993.
