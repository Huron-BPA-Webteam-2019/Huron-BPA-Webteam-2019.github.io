                            <p> Not all green homes are just energy centered. Green homes
                                utilize state of the art
                                construction techniques and use durable environmentally friendly materials to reduce

                            <p> Since green homes use state of the art
                                construction techniques, green homes are able to reduce leakages and minimize monthly

                                Prefabricated homes, a type of bio-home that is manufactured off site,
                                is a affordable solution that can cost under $20,000 depending on the company. </p>

                                even if a bio-home does not use a renewable energy source, it is engineered to reduce
                                leakages
                                and reduce energy consumption to reduce negative environmental impacts.

                            <p> Most modern houses rely on central air, or HVAC in order to heat or cool the home.
                                Improved insulation techniques help less thermal energy escape into the
                                atmosphere. </p>

                                increase the overall health and quality of life for individuals who live in areas with

                            <p> According to the European Commission, by the year 2030, 55% of all plastic should be
                                recycled because of the efforts of individuals who are trying to live in a more
                                eco-friendly housing lifestyle.
                            </p>
                            <p>     
                                In addition to this, by 2030 eco-friendly houses are projected to increase in
                                availability and decrease in
                                cost, encouraging more consumers to buy and invest in such housing. This helps to
                                further benefit the environment through the use of less pollutants that are derived from
                                regular commercial houses.
