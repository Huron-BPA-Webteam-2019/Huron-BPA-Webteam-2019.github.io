                            <p> While green energy has a high efficiency vs energy input, the energy yield it produces
                                is quite low.
                            
                                The energy sources which are used to power bio-homes, such as solar panels, can be quite
                                expensive.
                                Renewable energy sources tend to be vulnerable depending on the location of the energy
                                source, and so a proper, well-maintained place is required for these energy sources.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3 class="mb-5 mt-5"><b> Slow Energy</b> </h3>
                            <p> Renewable energy production is slow. This means that the customer has an energy
                                threshold on their monthly consumption. Homeowners must take in account the energy yield of their home by assessing the amount
                                of energy their home outputs. Homeowners may not be able to go completely solar if the energy consumption of their
                                home is too inefficient. Energy audits include use tools to analyze the efficiency of energy in homes.

                                Certain bio-homes have materials that are very expensive to use for building.
                                It can be difficult to sell your bio-homes once you buy them. This is because most
                                    realtors and buyers are not aware about green home products and the construction
                                    involved.
                                Bio-homes can often be hard to maintain for multiple different reasons which
                                    include
                                    high down-payment costs, bills, etc.

                                As most bio-homes have a high demand for solar energy, it raises the need for them
                                    to be placed in specific locations that can provide the most sunlight. This moves
                                    these bio-homes away from regular places to more isolated places.
                                Materials can be hard to find to build the bio-homes, especially in most urban
                                    areas which are not very bio-friendly areas (Urban areas constitute the majority of
                                    the human population).
                                Most bio-homes lack an air-cooling system, because they mostly run on heat sources
                                    and are not designed for hot areas because they do not have any air ventilation
                                    systems.

                                It accomplishes its goals by developing and enforcing rules and regulations for
                                companies
                                and states, and other entities. 
                                When planning a bio-home, be sure to follow regulations posted by the EPA. Failing to do
                                so will <u>result in the denial of a request</u>* to build a bio-home.

                            Zoning laws are region specific. Make sure to research the county's or city's zoning
                            laws to ensure you
                            do not violate any laws.

                            Typically, certain renewable energy types are not specified in a county's or city's
                            zoning laws, but are
                            often still allowed in that county or city.
                            Installation still holds many problems if there are not any specific rules about
                            renewable energy.
                            Neighbors or other residents could sue you for the
                            installation of a solar panel for a variety of reasons so make sure to properly review
                            the local area's zoning laws.

                                Most residential communities have an HOA and these HOAs have their own specific rules.
                                Some of the main functions of an HOA are to:
                                <ul>

                            When planning your bio-home or planning the installation of renewable energy sources, make sure to
                            consult with the HOA about specific rules regarding this matter.
                            In most residential areas, the HOA will approve of the installation of renewable energy or
                            construction of a bio-home as long as the state also approves as well.

                        <p>
                            For renewable energy, most states do not require licensing or certification, but licensing
                            or
                            certification is needed to be eligible for financial benefits.

                            shows requirements for industry professionals. Make sure you understand these licenses and
                            certifications and ensure your professional is using these standards.
                            If your area has an HOA, the HOA will investigate the professional that is installing your
                            system
                            and will notify you if they are following the HOA rules and regulations.
