                            <p> While green energy has a high efficiency vs energy input, the energy yield it produces
                                is quite low. <br>
                                The energy sources which are used to power bio-homes, such as solar panels, can be quite
                                expensive. <br>
                                Renewable energy sources tend to be vulnerable depending on the location of the energy
                                source, and so a proper, well-maintained place is required for these energy sources.<div>

                            <p> Renewable energy production is slow. This means that the customer has an energy

                                monthly consumption.<br>
                                Homeowners must take in account the energy yield of their home by assessing the amount
                                of energy their home outputs. <br>
                                Homeowners may not be able to go completely solar if the energy consumption of their
                                home is too inefficient. <br>

                                <div>Certain bio-homes have materials that are very expensive to use for building.</div>
                                <div>It can be difficult to sell your bio-homes once you buy them. This is because most
                                    realtors and buyers are not aware about green home products and the construction
                                    involved. </div>
                                <div>Bio-homes can often be hard to maintain for multiple different reasons which
                                    include

                                <div> As most bio-homes have a high demand for solar energy, it raises the need for them
                                    to be placed in specific locations that can provide the most sunlight. This moves
                                    these bio-homes away from regular places to more isolated places.</div>
                                <div> Materials can be hard to find to build the bio-homes, especially in most urban
                                    areas which are not very bio-friendly areas (Urban areas constitute the majority of
                                    the human population)</div>
                                <div> Most bio-homes lack an air-cooling system, because they mostly run on heat sources
                                    and are not designed for hot areas because they do not have any air ventilation

                            <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a governmental agency which seeks to protect
                                the health of humans and the environment.<br>
                                It accomplishes its goals by developing and enforcing rules and regulations for companies
                                and states, and other entities. <br>
                                When planning a bio-home, be sure to follow regulations posted by the EPA. Failing to do
                                so will result in the denial of a request to build a bio-home.

                                        need
                                        to look at what
                                        a Solar Power Purchase Agreement is. A Solar Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) is
                                        an
                                        agreement in which a third party operates the
                                        system and the customer hosts the system's electric output. You simply supply
                                        the
                                        property in which the solar panels are located. <br>

                            <p>The purpose of zoning laws is to regulate impacts that may not be in the best interests

                                including:

                                Zoning laws are often flexible since future plans are not always deterministic.

                                Typically, certain renewable energy types are not specified in a county's or city's
                                zoning laws, but are
                                often still allowed in that county or city.
                                Installation still holds many problems if there are not any specific rules about
                                renewable energy. </div>

                            <p>The Home Owner's Association is an organization created to regulate residential
                                communities.
                                Most residential communities have an HOA and these HOAs have their own specific rules.
                                Some of the main functions of an HOA are to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Set and approve various laws and conditions regarding the neighborhood. </li>
                                    <li>Review and manage residential complaints.</li>
                                    <li>Enforce rules set by the HOA. </li>
                                    <li>Create committees and manage them.</li>
                                </ul>

                            When planning your bio-home or planning the installation of renewable energy sources, make sure to consult with the HOA about specific rules regarding this matter. <br>
                            In most residential areas, the HOA will approve of the installation of renewable energy or construction of a bio-home as long as the state also approves as well.

                                    <p>
                                    For renewable energy, most states do not require licensing or certification, but licensing or certification is needed to be eligible for financial benefits.
                                The website <a href = "https://www.solarenergy.org/state-licensing-requirements/">Solarenergy.org</a> shows requirements for industry professionals. Make sure you understand these licenses and certifications and ensure your professional is using these standards.
                                If your area has an HOA, the HOA will investigate the professional that is installing your system and will notify you if they are following the HOA rules and regulations.
